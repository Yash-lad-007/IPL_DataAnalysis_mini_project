### Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Indian Premier League (IPL) matches and ball-by-ball data from the 2008 to 2020 seasons. The analysis uses Python and its data science libraries to uncover interesting insights and trends within the IPL data.

### Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run this notebook:
* `numpy`    
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib.pyplot` 
* `seaborn`

### Data
The analysis uses two primary datasets:
* `IPL Matches 2008-2020.csv`: Contains match-level information.
